## 📌 Project Description

The **Neon Weather App** is a web-based weather forecasting application that fetches and displays current weather data for any city entered by the user. This project demonstrates the integration of a third-party REST API into a responsive, animated front-end application.

Users can input a city name and receive live weather information, including:

If an invalid city is entered or a network error occurs, the app displays a graceful error message.
